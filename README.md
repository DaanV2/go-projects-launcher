# Projects Launcher Tool

A tool for launching projects, allowing you to search all your different projects and launch them. You configure the tool with where your projects are located and it will search for them and allow you to launch them. The program that will be used to launch the project is configurable. With filters, you can dynamically filter the projects that you want to launch.

```bash
go install github.com/DaanV2/go-projects-launcher@v1.1.1
go-projects-launcher setup
```

## Examples

```bash
go-projects-launcher some-project-folder-pattern

The config file:

    includes: [] # regex patterns that must match
    excludes: [] # regex patterns that must not match
ide_config:
  - ide: vscode-wsl

  - ide: vscode
    path_filter: ""
